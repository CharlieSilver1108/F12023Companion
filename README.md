### About:
This is an individual project, completed as an assignment for a Year 2 Module at the University of Exeter, using Java to build for Android. It was completed using Android Studio.

### The Project Description:
You will develop an Android app at your discretion in this task (e.g., weather app, gaming app, chatting app, news app, route planner app, photo viewer app, or music player app).
You are allowed to use any programming language you prefer, such as Java, Kotlin, or Dart.

#### My Rationale
My app is designed to help new Formula One fans gain better knowledge of the sport. It is called the F1 2023 Companion. My idea was that it would essentially be like the Pokédex from Pokémon, but for Formula One fans. The app will contain information about the drivers, the teams, the tracks, the races, the cars, and news. I wanted the app to have a very user-friendly design, and be very visually appealing while still presenting a surplus of data to the user. I achieved this by using many resources to provide images and logos to accompany the data being displayed. I focussed quite intensely on ensuring that my application was expandable. For this reason, I decided to use a database. This seemed like a very logical thing to implement since my overall vision for the app contains lots of complex, but structured data.
My app is configured in Java, the only additional implementations required being recyclerView, constraintLayout, and Room (note that for whatever reason, Room has only worked for me from API27 upward).

*It has been tested, and working, on Android Studio, android API 33, gradle 8.4.*

#### Future Improvements
One future improvement would definitely be expansion of the app - to implement some of the remaining packages. Although I took extra time to ensure that this should not be a momentous task, it would still involve lots of UI styling and tweaking. Another thing I was looking at was the ability to integrate an F1 API to add some more live data to the app, such as race updates/results instead of just historical data, however again my hardware limited me in doing so.
